## Notification API

Notifications can be very useful in any application and add very interesting features in terms of user experience. Here, we want to create a notification that is triggered by the backend without the frontend requesting. This means that the backend pushes the data towards the frontend.

We will be using SignalR , a ASP.NET core library that adds real-time web functionality to applications.
